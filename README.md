# loop-pack
Packaging algorithm for Loop
Fairly quick and dirty algorithm to recursively output all possible combinations of products that would fit a given tote size, given volumes. Used this project to teach myself Python.

Recently added loopPackNoDupes.py, which disallows duplicate entries using a binary number

TODO:
- Optimize I/O
- Optimize multithreading
- Explore different algorithms
